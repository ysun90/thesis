  abstract = {{Electron-driven fishbones provide a good test bed for the linear
	theory of fast-particle driven instabilities as they exhibit a very
	high sensitivity to the details of both the equilibrium and the electronic
	distribution function. Thus, they can help validate the models developed
	for studying instabilities driven by alpha particles in future fusion
	reactors such as ITER. The fishbone dispersion relation is extended
	to properly account for resonance with passing particles by including
	the contribution of the parallel motion to the resonance condition.
	Barely passing electrons are found to drive the mode unstable at
	a lower frequency than barely trapped electrons. Although globally
	destabilizing, the influence of passing electrons quickly decreases
	away from the trapped-passing boundary. This is confirmed by an analysis
	using distributions close to those obtained in electron cyclotron
	resonance heating experiments. The major effect of this new resonance
	condition is a reduction of the fast-electron density threshold coupled
	to a reduction of the frequency of the mode. (C) 2012 American Institute

	spectra from Tore Supra and TEXTOR reflectometers. QC modes have
	characteristics in between coherent and broad-band fluctuations as
	they oscillate around a given frequency but have a wide spectrum.
	They are ballooned at the LFS midplane and appear usually on a frequency
	ranging from 30 to 120 kHz. In ohmic plasmas from both tokamaks,
	QC modes are detected only in linear ohmic confinement (LOC) regime

	simulations from Tore Supra predict that the LOC and SOC regimes
	are dominated by electron and ion modes respectively. Measurements
	of the perpendicular velocity of density fluctuations have been made
	from the top of TEXTOR by poloidal correlation reflectometry. They
	suggest that QC modes have a phase velocity ∼400 m s −1 higher
	in the electron diamagnetic direction than lower frequency fluctuations.
	Additionally, the onset of QC modes during electron cyclotron resonance
	heating has been observed in a Tore Supra region where turbulence
	is suspected to be driven by electron modes. These experimental results
	and instability calculations show a correlation between onsets of
	QC modes and predictions of trapped electron modes.},

	For H-modes, ion temperature gradient (ITG) modes are found to be

	temperature profiles in self-consistent simulations. However, for
	hybrid regimes, in addition to ITG trapped electron modes (TEM) are

	presence of a large population of fast ions, quite important in low

  abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms responsible for particle transport is
	of the utmost importance for magnetized fusion plasmas. A peaked
	density profile is attractive to improve the fusion rate, which is
	proportional to the square of the density, and to self-generate a
	large fraction of non-inductive current required for continuous operation.
	Experiments in various tokamak devices (ASDEX Upgrade, DIII-D, JET,
	TCV, TEXT, TFTR) indicate the existence of a turbulent particle pinch.
	Recently, such a turbulent pinch has been unambiguously identified
	in Tore Supra very long discharges, in the absence of both collisional
	particle pinch and central particle source, for more than 4 min
	(Hoang et al 2003 Phys. Rev. Lett . 90 155002). This turbulent pinch
	is predicted by a quasilinear theory of particle transport (Weiland
	J et al 1989 Nucl. Fusion [http://stacks.iop.org/NuclFus/29/1810]
	29 1810 ), and confirmed by non-linear turbulence simulations (Garbet
	et al 2003 Phys. Rev. Lett . 91 035001) and general considerations
	based on the conservation of motion invariants (Baker et al 2004
	Phys. Plasmas 11 992). Experimentally, the particle pinch is found
	to be sensitive to the magnetic field gradient in many cases (Hoang
	et al 2004 Phys. Rev. Lett . 93 135003, Zabolotsky et al 2003 Plasma
	Phys. Control. Fusion [/0741-3335/45/5/315] 45 735 , Weisen et al
	2004 Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion [/0741-3335/46/5/003] 46 751 ,
	Baker et al 2000 Nucl. Fusion [/0029-5515/40/5/301] 40 1003 ), to
	the temperature profile (Hoang et al 2004 Phys. Rev. Lett . 93 135003,
	Angioni et al 2004 Nucl. Fusion [/0029-5515/44/8/003] 44 827 ) and
	also to the collisionality that changes the nature of the microturbulence
	(Angioni et al 2003 Phys. Rev. Lett . 90 205003, Garzotti et al 2003
	Nucl. Fusion [/0029-5515/43/12/025] 43 1829 , Weisen et al 2004 31st

	N J 1995 Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion [/0741-3335/37/8/001] 37 799
	). The consistency of some of the observed dependences with the theoretical
	predictions gives us a clearer understanding of the particle pinch
	in tokamaks, allowing us to predict more accurately the density profile
	in ITER.},

	simulations of the turbulence phase velocity v ph using the GS2 linear
	gyrokinetic code reveal a change in the dominant core turbulence
	from ion temperature gradient (ITG) to trapped electron mode (TEM)
	with decreasing collisionality. The transition coincides with the
	u ⊥ reversal. Extracting the E × B velocity from the measured
	u ⊥ and the simulation v ph indicates that the core radial electric
	field reverses sign with the turbulence. Using the radial force balance
	equation v E × B = v ⊥ − v * and measured diamagnetic velocities
	v * gives a perpendicular fluid velocity v ⊥ i reversing from ~
	5 to 7.5 km s −1 (ion direction) at low collisionality to −0.7 km s
	−1 (electron direction) at high collisionality. Neoclassical predictions
	using the NEOART and NCLASS codes give poloidal Deuterium fluid velocities
	too small by factor of ten. Toroidal ion fluid velocities would need
	to be significant (> 30 km s −1 ) at low ν * to account for
	the difference. A clear ITG to TEM transition in the core turbulence
	has also been demonstrated using on-axis electron cyclotron heating
	to perturb the collisionality.}

  abstract = {Non-local heat transport experiments were performed in Alcator C-Mod
	ohmic L-mode plasmas by inducing edge cooling with laser blow-off
	impurity (CaF 2 ) injection. The non-local effect, a cooling of the
	edge electron temperature with a rapid rise of the central electron
	temperature, which contradicts the assumption of ‘local’ transport,
	was observed in low collisionality linear ohmic confinement (LOC)
	regime plasmas. Transport analysis shows this phenomenon can be explained
	either by a fast drop of the core diffusivity, or the sudden appearance
	of a heat pinch. In high collisionality saturated ohmic confinement
	(SOC) regime plasmas, the thermal transport becomes ‘local’:
	the central electron temperature drops on the energy confinement
	time scale in response to the edge cooling. Measurements from a high
	resolution imaging x-ray spectrometer show that the ion temperature
	has a similar behaviour as the electron temperature in response to
	edge cooling, and that the transition density of non-locality correlates
	with the rotation reversal critical density. This connection may
	indicate the possible connection between thermal and momentum transport,
	which is also linked to a transition in turbulence dominance between
	trapped electron modes (TEMs) and ion temperature gradient (ITG)
	modes. Experiments with repetitive cold pulses in one discharge were
	also performed to allow Fourier analysis and to provide details of
	cold front propagation. These modulation experiments showed in LOC
	plasmas that the electron thermal transport is not purely diffusive,
	while in SOC the electron thermal transport is more diffusive like.
	Linear gyrokinetic simulations suggest the turbulence outside r /
	a = 0.75 changes from TEM dominance in LOC plasmas to ITG mode
	dominance in SOC plasmas.},

	in TORE SUPRA are discussed. Attention is focused on the saturation
	of the energy confinement time and it is emphasized that this saturation
	can be explained by a saturation of the electron heat diffusivity.
	The ion behaviour is indeed governed by dilution and equipartition
	effects. Although the ion heat transport is never neoclassical, there
	is no enhanced degradation at saturation. This behaviour is confirmed
	by turbulence measurements using CO 2 laser coherent scattering.
	The level of density fluctuations follows the electron heat diffusivity
	variations with the average density. Waves propagating in the ion
	diamagnetic direction are always present in turbulence frequency
	spectra. Thus, the saturation cannot be explained by the onset of
	an ion turbulence. The existence of ion turbulence in the edge at
	all densities cannot be excluded. However, this ion feature in scattering
	spectra could be explained by a Doppler shift associated with an
	inversion point of the radial electric field at the edge}

	of MHD instabilities identified as electron fishbone-like modes that
	appear in plasmas with lower hybrid current drive in FTU and Tore
	Supra tokamaks. Initially, the mode-induced electronic temperature
	oscillations measured by electron cyclotron emission were used to
	study the evolutions of the frequency and position of these modes.
	In FTU, where fishbones with and without bursting behaviour are observed,
	it was found that the evolutions of the mode position and frequency
	follow opposite trend in the two regimes. In Tore Supra, where abrupt
	changes between modes with different mode structures are often observed,
	it was found that the mode position evolves continuously and the
	wavenumbers follow an inverse cascade starting from an m / n = 4/4
	mode and finishing in an 1/1 mode. In a second step, the energy of
	resonant electrons was estimated from the resonant condition of the
	precession drift frequency. It was found that in Tore Supra the resonant
	condition does not change during the frequency jumps. The relevance
	of the correction due to the pitch angle of the resonant electrons
	and the possible role of the energetic passing particles in the drive
	of these modes are discussed from the results obtained in both machines.},

  abstract = {Experimental results on impurity transport in tokamaks are based on
	various techniques. We study here how the choice of the injection
	technique and of the analysis method influences the results. We have
	used three different injection techniques available in Tore Supra:
	laser blow-off, gas puff and supersonic molecular beam injection.
	We show that the long time duration of the gas puff injection compared
	with particle confinement time provides very limited information.
	The laser blow-off technique and supersonic pulsed injections give
	satisfactory results for diffusion but low quality convection estimates,
	presumably because the fast source term quenches the role of convection
	in the continuity equation. The best method is shown to be the combined
	analysis of supersonic pulsed injections and continuous puffing of
	a gaseous species. We obtain convection velocity profiles to an uncertainty
	of about 0.5 m s −1 . This method is applied to ohmic, weakly
	sawtoothing plasmas. The diffusion coefficient is independent of
	the impurity charge and the convection velocity is inward. Neoclassical
	calculations show that these plasmas are dominated by anomalous transport.
	Quasilinear gyrokinetic simulations are in qualitative agreement
	with the above experimental results. We deduce from the simulations
	that convection is dominated by the curvature term, which means that
	no charge dependence should be expected in this situation.},

	code for computing the LH waves propagation to a solver of the Fokker–Planck
	(FP) equation which calculates an electron distribution function
	self-consistently with the waves absorption. The DELPHINE code has
	been developed along this approach with accurate treatment of the
	magnetic equilibrium and the fast electrons dynamics in momentum

	LH waves propagation and absorption is investigated in detail. High

	high phase velocities, thus increasing the current drive efficiency
	of the waves. The shape of the current density profile also has an
	impact on the propagation of the waves and the resulting power deposition.
	In discharges where the current profile is dominated by LH current
	drive (LHCD), this dependence leads to the auto-regulation of the

	the period of the JET Joint Undertaking (1978-1999), with special
	emphasis on what has been learned for extrapolation to a NEXT STEP
	device. - Global confinement scaling has been extended to high currents
	and heating powers. Dimensionless scaling experiments of ELMy H mode
	plasmas suggest that bulk plasma transport is gyro-Bohm and predict
	ignition for a device with ITER-FDR parameters. Experiments in which
	the plasma elongation and triangularity were varied independently
	show a strong increase of confinement time with elongation (τ E
	~ κ a 0.8 ± 0.3 ), thus supporting a basic design principle of
	ITER-FEAT. With the Pellet Enhanced Performance (PEP) mode, JET has
	discovered the beneficial effect of reversed magnetic shear on confinement,
	opening the possibility of advanced tokamak scenarios. - With a three
	stage programme of progressively more closed divertors, JET has demonstrated
	the benefits of divertor closure, in particular, of high divertor
	neutral pressure which facilitates helium removal. It has also shown
	that in detached (or semidetached) radiative divertor plasmas the
	average power load on the target plates of a NEXT STEP device should
	be tolerable but, in addition, that the transient power loads during
	ELMs could cause problems. - In 1991 JET has demonstrated the first
	ever controlled production of a megawatt of fusion power. More extensive
	D-T experiments in 1997 (DTE1) have established new records in fusion
	performance: 16 MW transient fusion power with Q in = 0.62 (i.e.
	close to breakeven, Q in = 1) and 4 MW steady state fusion power
	with Q in = 0.18 for 4 s. DTE1 has also allowed a successful test
	of various reactor ICRF heating schemes and a clear demonstration
	of alpha particle heating, consistent with classical expectations.
	- JET has developed and tested some of the most important technologies
	for a NEXT STEP and a reactor, in particular the safe handling of
	tritium and the remote handling of large equipment as demonstrated
	by the Remote Divertor Exchange following DTE1.},

	and related velocity oscillations are measured for a large radial
	range. In the context of the latter the collisionality on the GAMs
	at the plasma edge is investigated. The measurement of the GAM related
	velocity fluctuations shows that the ZF occurs in two rings at least,
	separated by a rational surface. The velocity oscillation allows
	us to estimate the effect of GAMs on the shearing rate. The influence
	on the shearing rate is quantitatively investigated. The GAM induced
	shearing rate is not able to overcome the decorrelation rate of the
	ambient turbulence (AT). Also the relation between AT and GAMs is
	analyzed. Therefore the AT is characterized and the turbulence driving
	the GAMs is discussed. A relation between the density scale length
	and the pronounced occurrence of GAMs is obtained. This is related
	to a narrow region of k values, which is characteristic for drift
	ballooning modes. The spectrum of the AT is analyzed in both ZF rings.
	A significant change in the shape of the low frequency turbulence
	is obtained. This may be connected with a transition from drift ballooning
	modes to ITG modes. The latter seems to drive the GAMs less effectively.},

  abstract = {{In high temperature fusion plasmas the transport of energy and particles
	is commonly believed to be driven by turbulence. Turbulence quantities
	as correlation length and decorrelation time are important for the
	confinement properties of a plasma. Besides other diagnostics, correlation
	reflectometry has proven to be a suitable tool for the measurement
	of turbulence properties. At the medium sized Toroidal EXperiment
	for Technical Oriented Research (TEXTOR) the existing correlation
	reflectometry has been recently upgraded. A new reflectometer based
	on a microwave synthesizer has been developed and installed for the
	investigation of turbulence properties in a fusion plasma. Together
	with the existing reflectometer the measurement of radial correlation
	length and decorrelation time becomes available. Both reflectometers
	are computer controlled and allow to program individual frequency
	sequences and the duration of each frequency step. With the existing
	poloidal antenna array at theta=0 degrees and on top of the vacuum
	vessel, the system allows the measurement of radial correlation and
	poloidal correlations at the same time. First experiments have been
	performed and the results on the radial correlation length of density
	fluctuations in a fusion plasma are presented. {[}doi:10.1063/1.3497305]}},

  abstract = {The paper reports on the first measurements of long-range correlations
	along field lines in the center of ohmic plasmas at TEXTOR. The measurements
	are performed with correlation reflectometry. For the first time
	the poloidal, toroidal and radial extension of quasi-coherent modes
	are simultaneously investigated using correlation reflectometry at
	two poloidally and toroidally separated positions. The experiments
	also allow the local determination of the toroidal velocity from
	a combination of delay time estimation and safety factor measurements
	from the same instrument. The paper investigates whether turbulence
	and which kind of turbulence, with respect to the frequency range,
	is aligned along field lines and embedded on iso-density surfaces
	in ohmic plasmas. It especially addresses the question of the properties
	of coherent structures in the vicinity of the q = 1 surface by analyzing
	propagation times and coherence levels from short- and long-range
	correlations. The results are discussed within the context of quasi-coherent
	modes as observed at T-10, TEXTOR, Tore Supra and recently JET and
	which are linked to trapped electron modes. Furthermore, the experiment
	tries to investigate whether a treatment of turbulence in two dimensions
	is sufficient or if 3D geometry has to be used for the description
	of turbulence stimulated transport. This is of importance for the
	development of turbulence codes and simulations.},

  abstract = {The ASDEX Upgrade intrinsic rotation database has been expanded to
	include a large number of measurements from ohmic L-mode discharges
	covering a wide range of plasma densities, currents and magnetic
	fields. This database was then used to study the rotation behaviour
	across the transition from linear to saturated ohmic confinement
	(LOC/SOC). At low collisionality the plasma is in the LOC regime
	and the toroidal rotation profile is in the co-current direction.
	As the collisionality is increased and the plasma transitions from
	LOC to SOC, the core rotation decreases resulting in a hollow, counter-current
	profile. Even deeper in the SOC regime, however, a second reversal
	back towards the co-current direction occurs. Linear gyrokinetic
	calculations indicate that these reversals cannot be explained by
	a transition from a trapped electron mode (TEM) to an ion temperature
	gradient (ITG) dominated regime. Rather, the analysis indicates that
	the intrinsic normalized rotation gradient, u ′, depends strongly
	on local plasma parameters, in particular on ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0029-5515/54/4/043009/nf485743ieqn001.gif]
	{$R/L_{n_{\rm e}}$} . Taken together with turbulent particle transport
	theory, these results suggest that the co- to counter-current directed
	rotation reversal occurs in the TEM regime due to profile changes
	and not due to transition from TEM to ITG. The second reversal back
	to the co-current direction is explained by the reduction of ##IMG##

	{$R/L_{n_{\rm e}}$} observed in ITG dominated plasmas. Lastly, a
	simple linear model for the residual stress assuming a fixed poloidal
	tilt angle of the turbulent eddies was applied to the database. This
	model is able to capture the main parameter dependencies observed
	in the data and demonstrates that at least two processes contributing
	to the poloidal tilt of the turbulent eddies are needed to reproduce
	the experimentally observed u ′ values: one proportional to the
	sign of the turbulence propagation and the second independent of
	ω r .},

	Alfvén eigenmodes (BAEs) have been observed in Tore-Supra under
	ion cyclotron resonant heating. In this paper, the linear excitation
	threshold of these modes, thought to be driven by suprathermal ions,
	is calculated and compared with Tore-Supra observations. Similar
	studies of the linear excitation threshold of energetic particles
	driven modes were carried out previously for toroidal Alfvén eigenmodes
	or fishbones. In the case of BAEs, the main point is to understand
	whether the energetic particle drive is able to exceed ion Landau
	damping, which is expected to be important in the acoustic frequency
	range. For this, the BAE dispersion relation is computed and simplified
	in order to derive a tractable excitation criterion suitable for
	comparison with experiments. The observation of BAEs in Tore-Supra
	is found to be in agreement with the calculated criterion and confirms
	the possibility to trigger these modes in the presence of ion Landau
	damping. Moreover, the conducted analysis clearly puts forward the
	role of the global tunable parameters which play a role in the BAE
	excitation (the magnetic field, the density etc), as well as the
	role of some plasma profiles. In particular, the outcome of a modification
	of the shear or of the heating localization is found to be non-negligible
	and it is discussed in the paper.},

	a comparison of its parametric dependences with theoretical predictions.
	In this context, we have studied the behaviour of four different
	impurity species in Tore Supra lower-hybrid heated, sawtooth-free
	plasmas. We observe a decrease in the central impurity confinement
	time τ imp with increasing Z in the range explored (from 13 up to
	32). This result is in contradiction to both neoclassical and turbulent
	theoretical predictions. An analysis with the 1D impurity transport
	code ITC shows the existence of a central zone with reduced diffusion
	and indication of an inward convection. These results are completed
	with theoretical simulations of neoclassical transport (NCLASS) and
	turbulent transport with the quasilinear gyrokinetic QuaLiKiz and
	nonlinear gyrofluid TRB models. These simulations do not provide
	an explanation of the confinement time dependence on the impurity
	charge. Transport outside r / a = 0.3 is well described by the nonlinear
	turbulent calculations but the central region is predicted to be
	below the turbulence threshold while the observed transport is one
	order of magnitude higher than neoclassical values. The gyrokinetic
	calculations evidence the dominant role of the curvature pinch in
	the total convective flux. This term is directed inwards and only
	weakly dependent on the impurity charge in the explored range of
	species.},

	on transport, turbulence and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD). The emphasis
	is put on some new results from Tore-Supra. Combining the density
	profile and fluctuation measurement, it was shown on Tore-Supra that
	the particle pinch inside the q = 1 surface is close to the neoclassical
	value in ohmic plasma, while the observed small diffusion is in agreement
	with a very low level of density fluctuations inside the q = 1 surface.
	In β scaling experiments, no change in the fluctuation levels was
	found on Tore-Supra, in agreement with the observation of weak confinement
	degradation with increasing β. Zonal flows have been detected by
	Doppler reflectometry in ASDEX-U and with correlation reflectometry
	in T-10. On Tore-Supra, a fast decrease in the density fluctuation
	level at high poloidal wavenumbers was measured with Doppler reflectometry,
	suggesting a minor role of electron temperature gradient driven modes.
	Various forms of Alfvén eigenmodes (toroidal Alfvén eigenmodes,
	Alfvén cascades and possibly beta Alfvén eigenmodes) have been
	detected with reflectometry in TFTR, JET and Tore-Supra. The density
	fluctuations induced by the mode were found to be higher on the high-field

	and toroidal rotation are measured with x-ray imaging crystal spectroscopy

	achieved using co-current 1.3 MW NBI, and a 0.35 MW ECH pulse is

  abstract = {The relationship between particle and heat transport in an internal
	transport barrier (ITB) has been systematically investigated in reversed
	shear (RS) and high β p mode plasmas of JT-60U. The electron effective
	diffusivity is well correlated with the ion thermal diffusivity in
	the ITB region. The ratio of particle flux to electron heat flux,
	calculated on the basis of the linear stability analysis, shows a
	similar tendency to an experiment in the RS plasma with a strong
	ITB. However, the calculated ratio of ion anomalous heat flux to
	electron heat flux is smaller than the experiment in the ITB region.
	Helium and carbon are not accumulated inside the ITB even with ion
	heat transport close to a neoclassical level, but argon is accumulated.
	The helium diffusivity ( D He ) and the ion thermal diffusivity (χ
	i ) are 5–15 times higher than the neoclassical level in the high
	β p mode plasma. In the RS plasma, D He is reduced from 6–7 times
	to a 1.4–2 times higher level than the neoclassical level when
	χ i is reduced from 7–18 times to a 1.2–2.6 times higher level
	than the neoclassical level. The carbon and argon diffusivities estimated
	assuming the neoclassical inward convection velocity are 4–5 times
	larger than the neoclassical value, even when χ i is close to the
	neoclassical level. Argon exhaust from the inside of the ITB is demonstrated
	by applying electron cyclotron heating (ECH) in the high β p mode
	plasma, where both electron and argon density profiles become flatter.
	The flattening of the argon density profile is consistent with the
	reduction of the neoclassical inward convection velocity due to the
	reduction of the bulk plasma density gradient. In the RS plasma,
	the density gradient is not decreased by ECH and argon is not exhausted.
	These results suggest the importance of density gradient control
	in suppressing impurity accumulation.},

  abstract = {Two aspects of edge turbulence and transport in Alcator C-Mod are
	explored. The quasi-coherent mode (QCM), an edge fluctuation present
	in Enhanced Dα H-mode plasmas, is examined with regard to its role
	in the enhanced particle transport found in these plasmas, its in/out
	asymmetry, its poloidal wave number and its radial width and location.
	It is shown to play a dominant role in the perpendicular particle
	transport. The QCM is not observed at the inboard midplane, indicating
	that its amplitude there is significantly smaller than on the outboard
	side. The peak amplitude of the QCM is found just inside the separatrix,
	with a radial width ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gtrsim.gif]
	{gtrsim} 5 mm, leading to a non-zero amplitude outside the separatrix
	and qualitatively consistent with its transport enhancement. Also
	examined are the characteristics of the intermittent convective transport,
	associated with the larger scale turbulent structures, also called
	blobs, and typically occurring in the scrape-off-layer (SOL). These
	turbulent structures are qualitatively similar in L- and H-mode.
	When their perpendicular extent, occurrence frequencies and magnitudes
	are compared, it is found that their size is somewhat smaller in
	ELMfree H-Mode, while their frequency is similar. A clear difference
	is seen in the magnitude of these turbulent fluctuations in the far
	SOL, with ELMfree H-mode showing a smaller perturbation there than
	L-mode. As the Greenwald density limit is approached ( n / n GW ≥
	0.7), blobs are seen inside the separatrix consistent with the observation
	that the high cross-field transport region, normally found in the
	far SOL, penetrates the closed flux surfaces at high n / n GW .},

	near zero and specific oscillations at 15kHz. All experimentally
	measured properties of low frequency and high frequency quasi-coherent
	oscillations are in good agreement with predictions of linear theory

	instabilities. Significant local changes in the turbulence characteristics

	transport can be close to the neoclassical level. Generally, however,
	radial transport is enhanced by instabilities. There is evidence
	that anomalous ion heat and momentum transport may be caused by turbulence
	driven by the ion temperature gradient. The same level of understanding
	is not reached in electron heat and particle transport. Electron
	heat transport is characterized by a highly nonlinear relation between
	heat flux and temperature gradient. Particle transport is strongly
	governed by off-diagonal contributions. Where possible, the tokamak
	results are compared with those from stellarators, in particular
	with those from W7-AS. Such a comparison is meaningful because stellarators
	and tokamaks share many transport aspects. In both cases transport
	is generally anomalous, degrades with heating power and increases
	toward the edge. Bifurcations such as the tokamak H-mode transition
	are also observed in the W7-AS stellarator. Transport in stellarators,
	although anomalous, seems to be less confused by additional complexities
	such as large off-diagonal contributions, profile resilience, disparities
	between steady-state and perturbatively determined transport coefficients
	and an isotopic mass dependence in energy and particle transport.
	Differences in magnetic field and minor radius scaling seem to be
	introduced by operational restrictions: rotational transform iota
	is constant in stellarator field or size scans whereas q a generally

	{$\nu_{{\rm e}}^{\ast}$} . Detailed analysis from edge Langmuir probe
	has revealed that the HFM propagates in the electron diamagnetic
	direction in both the lab frame and the plasma frame. The decorrelation
	rate of HFM is smaller than the maximum E × B shearing rate at
	the steep gradient region by an order of magnitude. Furthermore,
	the growth, saturation and oscillations of HFM, including both frequency
	and amplitude, are strongly correlated with the evolution of pressure
	gradient. Thus, the limit-cycle-like oscillations between the amplitude
	and the frequency of HFM may play an important role in the formation
	and saturation of pedestal. During the saturation phase of pedestal
	pressure gradient, the HFM, sometimes accompanied by a mid-frequency
	(∼80 kHz) quasi-coherent mode, drives strong cross-field transport
	resulting in small crashes of pressure gradient and finally limits
	the pressure gradient.},

  abstract = {An improved energy confinement regime, I-mode, is studied in Alcator
	C-Mod, a compact high-field divertor tokamak using ion cyclotron
	range of frequencies (ICRFs) auxiliary heating. I-mode features an
	edge energy transport barrier without an accompanying particle barrier,
	leading to several performance benefits. H-mode energy confinement
	is obtained without core impurity accumulation, resulting in reduced
	impurity radiation with a high- Z metal wall and ICRF heating. I-mode
	has a stationary temperature pedestal with edge localized modes typically
	absent, while plasma density is controlled using divertor cryopumping.
	I-mode is a confinement regime that appears distinct from both L-mode
	and H-mode, combining the most favourable elements of both. The I-mode
	regime is investigated predominately with ion ∇ B drift away from
	the active X-point. The transition from L-mode to I-mode is primarily
	identified by the formation of a high temperature edge pedestal,
	while the edge density profile remains nearly identical to L-mode.
	Laser blowoff injection shows that I-mode core impurity confinement
	times are nearly identical with those in L-mode, despite the enhanced
	energy confinement. In addition, a weakly coherent edge MHD mode
	is apparent at high frequency ~100–300 kHz which appears to increase
